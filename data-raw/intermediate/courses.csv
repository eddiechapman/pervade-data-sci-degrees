In the second part, we apply these principles and theories to the key moral issues in business (with emphasis, where appropriate and relevant, on questions dealing with data/information acquisition, analysis, and application) by studying, discussing, and debating them, principally through a case-study approach. The focus of our attention is on the three basic kinds of moral relationships in business: a) between the firm and the employee; b) between the firm and other economic agents (i.e., customers, competitors); and c) between the firm and various non-business groups (i.e., the environment). 3 credits"

110,894,
110,894,L.MBA 509 Big Data Ecosystem*
110,894,
110,894,"This course examines the data management process from access to data sources through implementation of scalable processes. Big data requires understanding database design, and increasingly involves parallel processing and cloud-based data storage and analysis. Data formats and database architectures are examined. Tools for extracting data from relational, structured, and non-structured databases are explored. Included are issues related to data security and governance. Students will also learn how to evaluate technologies used to implement scalable decision analytic systems. 3 credits"
110,894,
110,894,L.MBA 550 Data Visualization*
110,894,
110,894,"Data/Information visualization is widely used in a number of industries, including business, engineering, and media disciplines to help people analyze and understand what the data is telling us. The industry has grown exponentially over the last few years, and as a result there are more tools available to help us quickly and efficiently create compelling visualizations. 3 credits"
110,894,
110,894,"This course provides an overview of the data/information visualization discipline. Using a hands-on approach, readings and lectures will cover various visualization principles and tools. Our labs will focus on practical introductions to tools and frameworks, with plenty of time to explore & utilize additional applications. We will discuss existing visualizations (e.g. what we find in various publications and government data sources) and critique their effectiveness in conveying information. All students are expected to participate in class discussion, complete lab assignments, and create & critique many data visualization examples throughout the session. 3 credits"

110,894,L.MBA 520 Data Science*
110,894,
110,894,"Analytics is the process of taking data and turning it into new forms of value. The beginning of this process is often referred to as Data Science and the second stage of the process encompasses algorithms and visualization. As an introduction to data science, we proceed to cover practical data analytic skills including accessing and transferring data (ETL – extract, transform, load), applying analytical frameworks or patterns, applying methods from data mining and machine learning, and learning analysis methods for processing text. The course will also provide students an opportunity to do hands-on exercises with Big Data. The emphasis will be on practical usefulness and analytics patterns. 3 credits"
110,894,
110,894,L.MBA 530 Analytics Methods*
110,894,
110,894,"Business Analytics is the process of transforming data into business value. This process is often broken into stages of Data Science and Analytics Methods. The purpose of Analytics Methods is to use the data and rules resulting from data science methods and develop, test, and innovate business intelligence models to help solve common business problems. These methods originate in the fields of operations research, simulation, statistics, and machine learning. In this course, we model common business problems from the business domains of logistics, finance, marketing, and operations management using spreadsheets. 3 credits"

110,894,L.MBA 512 Business Strategy for Analytics
110,894,
110,894,"This course examines how analytics can be applied in various parts of the value chain. Students, working in teams, select an industry or canonical company and identify how analytics can be applied in various parts of its value chain. From this, they map out drivers of analytics value in the industry, and identify examples of analytics across functional areas or – ideally – segments of the value chain, for different users and with different time frames, e.g. smaller-data, more synthetic, strategic decisions for executives, down to real-time predictive analytics embedded in operational systems. Students will also examine how different functional managers (e.g., CFO, CTO, etc.) would view analytics decisions. 3 credits"

110,894,
110,894,"In this course, students will build on the basic undergraduate microeconomic framework by application and evaluation of theoretical models of decision making specifically related to business operations. Managerial economic analysis will proceed by covering practical microeconomic skills including supply and demand theory, consumer theory, cost analysis, market structures, regulation, and forecasting economic models. Exploration of these models will include derivation and application geared toward scenarios applicable from a managerial perspective. The course will also provide students an opportunity to do hands-on exercises with data to aid in application and interpretation of data in a microeconomic framework to comprehend and interpret consumer behavior and influence appropriate decision making within business settings. 3 credits"

110,894,L.MBA 540 Machine Intelligence
110,894,
110,894,"Machine intelligence involves the set of technologies that permit computers to learn, including pattern recognition (text, image, and data), classification modeling, recommendation systems, natural language processing, and a variety of applications that increasingly are part of everyday life. Often referred to as “artificial intelligence,” this course goes further to explore techniques (such as recurrent neural networks and deep learning) which automate the ability of computers to recognize and identify patterns and learn from these. These techniques are scalable in ways that provide automatic implementation – ranging from web search algorithms to intelligent agents to self-driving cars. This course will provide hands-on experience building such systems, but with the focus on understanding the implications for business. Students will gain an appreciation for the scope of potential applications, the limits of machine intelligence, ethical aspects of their use, and disruptive tendencies of these technologies. 3 credits"
110,894,
110,894,L.MBA 555 Financial Management
110,894,
110,894,"The objective of this course is to help students understand financial decision making and modeling and how these are impacted by real world uncertainty. To achieve this, students will review basic financial concepts and then work on applying them through case studies and a course project. This is all done in the context of the need for socially responsible decisions to be made with all stakeholders in mind. Students will also learn about a variety of financial regulations and why they have been put in place."
110,894,
110,894,"Through the use of case studies and using Microsoft Excel, students will apply financial concepts to evaluate and analyze decisions that businesses make. To understand how financial decisions are made, students will create their own financial projections for a company and experience how financial decision making is impacted by the assumptions that go into the financial model. Financial concepts will include: current financial statement analysis and how to forecast future financial statements; capital budgeting; the cost of capital; financing operations; and risk management. 3 credits"
110,894,
110,894,L.MBA 571 Risk Analysis
110,894,
110,894,"An important part of business planning is identification, analysis, and management of risk. This spreadsheet-based course examines a variety of models geared to addressing business and social needs. Uncertainty is explicitly analyzed through the use of scenarios, simulation, and other techniques. Emphasis is placed on understanding and communicating the important uncertainties associated with any plan, and developing ways to incorporate these into business plans. 3 credits"
110,894,
110,894,L.MBA 581 Capstone Project
110,894,
110,894,"The goal of this course is to have students complete a data project (generally in groups) of a complex nature. This includes obtaining and cleaning relevant data, conducting appropriate analysis and communications of findings, and planning implementation of organizational processes that utilize the results of the project.

178,807,
178,807,"With the advent of social networks, ubiquitous sensors, and large-scale computational science, data scientists must deal with data that is massive in size, arrives at blinding speeds, and often must be processed within interactive or quasi-interactive time frames. This course studies the mathematical foundations of big data processing, developing algorithms and learning how to analyze them. We explore methods for sampling, sketching, and distributed processing of large scale databases, graphs, and data streams for purposes of scalable statistical description, querying, pattern mining, and learning. Was COMPSCI 590D. Undergraduate Prerequisites: COMPSCI 240 and COMPSCI 311. 3 credits"

178,807,COMPSCI 585: Introduction to Natural Language Processing
178,807,
178,807,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the engineering art and science of how to teach computers to understand human language. NLP is a type of artificial intelligence technology, and it's now ubiquitous -- NLP lets us talk to our phones, use the web to answer questions, map out discussions in books and social media, and even translate between human languages. Since language is rich, subtle, ambiguous, and very difficult for computers to understand, these systems can sometimes seem like magic -- but these are engineering problems we can tackle with data, math, machine learning, and insights from linguistics. This course will introduce NLP methods and applications including probabilistic language models, machine translation, and parsing algorithms for syntax and the deeper meaning of text. During the course, students will (1) learn and derive mathematical models and algorithms for NLP; (2) become familiar with basic facts about human language that motivate them, and help practitioners know what problems are possible to solve; and (3) complete a series of hands-on projects to implement, experiment with, and improve NLP models, gaining practical skills for natural language systems engineering"

Students will learn the major concepts, tools, and techniques for what informatics can do for cities. It includes background in computation, statistics, error analysis, data acquisition, management, integration, working with large datasets and understanding data sources. The course covers topics in visualization, data analysis and modeling, and machine learning, focusing on their application on urban problems, and including material not usually covered in computer science courses: how to handle spatial-temporal data, GIS, issues related to citizen science and participatory sensing, instrumentation, physical sensors, imagery, and issues of data ethics, privacy. This class is Python based."
277,1310,
277,1310,Civic Analytics & Urban Intelligence
277,1310,
277,1310,"This course introduces students to computational approaches to urban challenges through the lens of city operations, public policy, and urban planning. Students are exposed to a range of analytical techniques and methods from the perspective of urban decision-making. Issues of city governance, structure, and history are presented to understand how to identify and assess urban problems, collect and organize appropriate data, utilize suitable analytical approaches, and ultimately produce results that recognize the constraints faced by city agencies and policymakers. This is not an easy task, and requires an understanding of urban social and political dynamics and a significant appreciation of data governance, privacy, and ethics. Specific attention is given to domain areas of energy and building efficiency, transportation, public health and emergency response, waste, water, and social connectivity and resilience, as well as the deployment of urban technology at the neighborhood scale. The role of civic engagement and community participation in the context of open data and citizen science is explored, as well as the evolving relationship between, and influence of, informatics on urban governance. Top-down and bottom-up models of innovative service delivery are discussed and debated in the context of public decision-making. Case studies and best practice examples from U.S. and global cities are used extensively, with a particular focus on New York City."

277,1310,CUSP-GX-6004: Justice Systems Algorithms
277,1310,
277,1310,"The growing use of data-centric technologies is transforming criminal justice in the United States. These technologies affect the scale and nature of collected data, enable the detection of discriminatory patterns of policing, and influence bail recommendations for pretrial detainees, among other things. Modern computational and statistical methods offer the promise of increased efficiency, equity, and transparency, but their use raises complex legal, social, and ethical questions. In this course, we will discuss the application of techniques from machine learning and statistics to a variety of criminal justice issues, analyze recent court decisions, and examine the relationships between law, public policy, and data. The course will involve readings and class discussion, short assignments, and a data-intensive semester-long project. The course will also feature guest speakers who work in the criminal justice domain. Students should have basic knowledge of statistics, programming, and supervised machine learning, but no prior knowledge of the criminal justice system will be assumed."

277,1310,CUSP-GX-6004: Managing IT
277,1310,
277,1310,"All new public sector and private systems are information technology (IT) systems. This course will improve your IT IQ. It will explain how to create and operate IT systems and task IT staff so that they meet stakeholder expectations for improving productivity, cost effectiveness, availability and address other government and business challenges. The information in the course will also help students more productively interact with IT professionals to be more satisfied IT customers. IT system development and use have gotten a reputation for problems and high costs. We’ve read about data breaches at popular companies such as Yahoo, Target, Apple, and IBM. We’ve also read about or maybe even experienced well-known failures like the launch of the US’ Healthcare.gov and NYC’s CityTime payroll management system. Well known fiascoes like these cause people to think that it’s impossible to deliver and operate quality IT systems. How then can government and business improve their operations? Organizations can achieve high performance creating and running IT systems by using well researched and documented practices to deliver IT projects and conduct IT operations with high levels of quality. Many best practices can be found in both the private and public sectors. This course will emphasize best practices for public sector organizations."

277,1310,CUSP-GX-6005
277,1310,
277,1310,"The world’s urban population is growing by nearly 60 million per year; equivalent to four cities like New York annually. Monitoring the chronological growth of key attributes of cities, as well as quantifying their current conditions presents a great potential for positive change. Through the acquisition of new data, there are immediate opportunities to influence the sustainable growth of small and medium size cities. There is also the potential for alleviating the extremes in Megacities, where conditions have reached a critical and unmanageable state. Looking at cities as interdependent networks of physical, natural and human systems, this course provides a perspective on how to monitor the function and wellness of these systems. Students obtain an understanding of needs assessment, planning, and technical approaches for instrumenting a city. This includes monitoring patterns of activity, mobility, energy, land use, physical and lifeline infrastructure, urban ecology, vegetation, atmosphere and air quality. The expected outcomes of this course is a comprehensive understanding of what can be instrumented and the monitoring architecture for acquiring and generating new data about cities."

Some traditional marketing strategies are now completely outdated, others have been deeply transformed, and new digital marketing strategies are continuously emerging based on the unprecedented access to vast amounts of information about products, firms, and consumer behavior. The Internet is now encroaching core business activities such as new product design, advertising, marketing and sales, creation of word-of-mouth, new start-up funding, and customer service. Our goal in this class is to discuss the new business models in electronic commerce that have been enabled by Internet-based social media and advertising technologies, and to analyze the impact these technologies and business models have on industries, firms, and people. We will inform our discussions with insights from data and metrics that can guide us for measurement. To recognize how businesses can successfully leverage these technologies, we will therefore go beyond the technology itself and investigate some key questions."

281,1939,"Course description: This course will change the way you think about data and its role in business. Businesses, governments, and individuals create massive collections of data as a byproduct of their activity. Increasingly, decision-makers and systems rely on intelligent technology to analyze data systematically to improve decision-making. In many cases, automating analytical and decision-making processes is necessary because of the volume of data and the speed with which new data are generated. We will examine how data analysis technologies can be used to improve decision-making. We will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining, and we will examine real-world examples and cases to place data-mining techniques in context, to develop data-analytic thinking, and to illustrate that proper application is as much an art as it is a science. In addition, we will work “hands-on” with data mining software."

281,1939,Previously taught by: Panos Ipeirotis
281,1939,
281,1939,"Course description: All analytics projects rely on data. A crucial step in a business analytics process is creating the dataset that will be analyzed. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the stakeholders do not pay serious attention at this step; however, streamlining and understanding the data often takes 90% of the effort and time of a data analytics project. Furthermore, because most people do not know how the dataset was created, they miss important details and assumptions that were part of the data gathering and handling process, leading to serious problems down the road. This class is designed to teach students to handle data programmatically, without being software engineers. This course guides students through the whole data management process, from initial data acquisition to final data analysis. From a tools perspective, we cover Python and SQL. SQL is the lingua franca for all data analysts, and virtually all companies store their data in SQL-accessible repositories. Python serves as a great general-purpose programming language for a wide variety of data management tasks, and is commonly used as the “glue” that brings together all the different aspects of the analytics process."

R is a fast growing technology that has been witnessing widespread acceptance both in academia and industry. Recent surveys have even put it in the top regarding usage by professional data miners (Rexer Analytics survey, 2013). There are many factors contributing for this acceptance, but clearly these include the price (free), being open source (trustworthy software that can be easily inspected/checked for flaws), the extension of available methods (exponential growth of the set of available methods for different application areas), and the available support from the community (an extremely large community of knowledgeable experts proving top-notch support for free). This course illustrates the use of R for several key data mining processes. This illustration will be driven by concrete case studies that we will “solve” using R. The course can be regarded as a hands-on complement of the Data Science for Business Analytics."

281,1939,"Course description: In every aspect of our daily lives, from the way we work, shop, communicate, or socialize, we are both consuming and creating vast amounts of information. More often than not, these daily activities create a trail of digitized data that is being stored, mined, and analyzed by firms hoping to create valuable business intelligence. With technological advances and developments in customer databases, firms have access to vast amounts of high-quality data which allows them to understand customer behavior and customize business tactics to increasingly fine segments or even segments of one. However, much of the promise of such data-driven policies has failed to materialize because managers find it difficult to translate customer data into actionable policies. The general objective of this course is to fill this gap by providing students with tools and techniques that can be utilized for making business decisions. Note that this is not a statistics or mathematics course. The emphasis of the class will be on applications and interpretation of the results for making real life business decisions."

These insights can be used to make sales forecasts, which in turn can inform assortment and production planning decisions. Optimization models have played a very important role in turning “insights” into “decisions” for companies in various industries: advertising, airlines, energy, investment and finance, marketing, manufacturing, retailing, etc. This course is aimed at enriching the student exposure to business analytics techniques. It has two main parts. The first part covers sensitivity analysis, which is a follow-up of the linear programming topic covered in the Decision Models course, and which relates to understanding the impact of changing the parameters of a model on the optimal solution. It is executed using Excel Solver. The second part, which spans most of the course, covers decision making under uncertainty. Students will learn how to build optimization models that incorporate random parameters (e.g., stochastic demand, price, etc.)."

281,1939,"Course description: There is a growing sense of urgency around the ethics of analytics. Harvard Business Review, for instance, declared that “oversight for algorithms” and “data privacy” would be among the top trends that business professionals could not ignore in 2016. Our class will tackle these topics head-on. Together, we will explore what it means to use analytics ethically and how to think about its ethical implications. We will approach these matters from the perspective of professionals who lead analytics-oriented teams or organizations, and whose success depends on their ability to recognize the ethical issues at stake and resolve these to the satisfaction of multiple stakeholders."

281,1939,"Course description: This course focuses on significant strategic decisions—such as the introduction of new products or the acquisition of another firm—and explores how data-driven and analytical approaches can be used to inform these decisions from a senior management perspective. A case-based approach allows us to discuss details of significant strategic decisions. We will cover some core aspects of business strategy, including external analysis, competitor analysis, and opportunity analysis. We will also look more deeply at different aspects of the decision-making process within organizations, both to understand the process and to think about implementation. The goal is to understand the role of analytics and analytical approaches in the broader organization."

281,1939,
281,1939,"The Capstone project, which students work on throughout the year, is presented at the culmination of the program. This integrative exercise gives students an opportunity to review and interpret data through statistical and operational analysis with the use of predictive models and the application of optimization techniques. The result is a unified and practical case presentation on a topic of the group's choosing. This is a team-based project with approximately 4-6 students per group. The integrative projects should not take the form of formal dissertations or narrative papers. Rather, they should take the form of “reports to management,” emphasizing substance over length and the forest over the trees. Where possible, they should be action-oriented and framed in terms of business policy and competitive strategy. Given this format, they should be easily convertible into PowerPoint presentations."

1041,909,"The field of computer science is experiencing a transition from processing-intensive to data-intensive problems, wherein data is produced in massive amounts by large sensor networks, simulations, and social networks. Efficiently extracting, interpreting, and learning from these very large data sets need different storage and processing requirements compared to traditional business applications that are mostly dependent on relational database management systems. These emerging data-intensive applications require heavy read/write workloads and do not need some of the stringent schema and ACID properties that are central to relational databases. To cope with these requirements, a new genre of large-scale systems, is introduced that is called NoSQL databases. The main characteristics of NoSQL databases are that they are open source, non-schema oriented, having weak consistency properties and heavily distributed over large and clusters of commodity hardware.

1081,2040,Object Oriented Programming I [22:839:614]
1081,2040,
1081,2040,"The goal of this year-long sequence of courses is to give a rigorous introduction to computer programming and software engineering with special emphasis on applications to financial engineering. Our primary programming language will be C++. This programming language is fast enough to accommodate the performance demanded in financial environments. At the same time C++ is an object oriented language and, as such, is suitable for modern software design. In this course the assumption is that students have had no background in computer programming, although even people who are familiar with some programming language will hopefully benefit and learn new material. In part I in the Fall semester the course will start with basic concepts of programming, but we quickly get into topics in object oriented programming, UML diagrams, and basic patterns. We will also include introduction to basic algorithms and data structures. In part II in the Spring semester, more advanced topics will be covered, including advanced algorithms and data structures especially through introduction to STL and boost libraries, numerical algorithms and introduction to BLAS and LAPACK libraries, design of graphical user interfaces, and concurrent programming (also known as multiprogramming)."

1081,2040,
1081,2040,"This course is intended for business students of data mining[1] techniques with these goals: 1) To provide the key methods of classification, prediction, reduction, and exploration that are at the heart of data mining; 2) To provide business decision-making context for these methods; 3) Using real business cases, to illustrate the application and interpretation of these methods. The course will cover Classification (e.g. helps banks to determine who will default on a loan, or email filters to determine which emails are spam), Clustering (like classification, but groups are not predefined, as in legitimate vs. spam email, so the algorithm will try to group similar email together for instance), Regression (e.g. how ad campaigns in offline media such as print, audio and TV affect online interest in the advertiser's brand), Association Rule Learning (enables merchants, for example Amazon, to determine which items customers tend to buy together and make suggestions for further purchase, otherwise known as ""market basket analysis""); and Neural Nets (helps financial agents to model complex markets for high frequency trading; helps Pandora adapt to your personal radio station). The pedagogical style will use business cases so the student can follow along and implement the algorithms on his or her own with a very shallow learning curve. In addition, students will work in teams to mine their own data. Individual students may request to work on their own company data. The computation platform with be the R Programming language and the specialized packages in data mining."

1202,806,
1202,806,"How can we use computers to design systems and, more generally, make decisions, in the face of complexity and uncertainty? Simulation techniques apply the power of the computer to study complex stochastic systems when analytical or numerical techniques do not suffice. It is the most frequently used methodology for the design and evaluation of computer, telecommunication, manufacturing, healthcare, financial, and transportation systems, to name just a few application areas. Simulation is an interdisciplinary subject, incorporating ideas and techniques from computer science, probability, statistics, optimization, and number theory. Simulation models, which embody deep domain expertise, can effectively complement machine-learning approaches. This course will provide the student with a hands-on introduction into this fascinating and useful subject."

They enable the compact representation and manipulation of exponentially large probability distributions, which allows them to efficiently manage the uncertainty and partial observability that commonly occur in real-world problems. As a result, graphical models have become invaluable tools in a wide range of areas from computer vision and sensor networks to natural language processing and computational biology. The aim of this course is to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively design, implement and apply these models to solve real problems. The course will cover (a) Bayesian and Markov networks and their dynamic and relational extensions; (b) exact and approximate inference methods; (c) estimation of both the parameters and structure of graphical models."

1295,951,"Data mining describes approaches to turning data into information. Rather than the more typical deductive strategy of building models using known principles, data mining uses inductive approaches to discover the appropriate models. These models describe a relationship between a system's response and a set of factors or predictor variables. Data mining in this context provides a formal basis for machine learning and knowledge discovery. This course investigates the construction of empirical models from data mining for systems with both discrete and continuous valued responses. It covers both estimation and classification, and explores both practical and theoretical aspects of data mining."

These models will be created using reproducible data science workflows, using modern statistical programming tools and techniques. The course will first focus on obtaining data from various sources, preparing and transforming data as needed for downstream analysis, and performing exploratory data analysis. We’ll then look at the most important descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytic techniques for analytical financial modeling."

1339,94,Financial Economics
1339,94,"This course provides an overview of the theory of financial markets from an economic perspective. The major conceptual tool that is used to study these phenomena is the notion of economic equilibrium. The course will build an understanding of the role of financial markets in hedging and insuring participants against risks. It will also cover the efficiency properties of financial markets and stress the perverse equilibrium effects that less-than-perfect financial markets can have: how vulnerable they may be to self-fulfilling prophecies and (ir)rational exuberance; the possibility of financial crises, in particular of bank runs, as self-fulfilling prophecies; and whether or not financial markets transmit and spread information that some traders have privately acquired on companies, currencies and other events."
