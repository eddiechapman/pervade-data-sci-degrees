178,1,
178,10583,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the engineering art and science of how to teach computers to understand human language. NLP is a type of artificial intelligence technology, and it's now ubiquitous -- NLP lets us talk to our phones, use the web to answer questions, map out discussions in books and social media, and even translate between human languages. Since language is rich, subtle, ambiguous, and very difficult for computers to understand, these systems can sometimes seem like magic -- but these are engineering problems we can tackle with data, math, machine learning, and insights from linguistics. This course will introduce NLP methods and applications including probabilistic language models, machine translation, and parsing algorithms for syntax and the deeper meaning of text. During the course, students will (1) learn and derive mathematical models and algorithms for NLP; (2) become familiar with basic facts about human language that motivate them, and help practitioners know what problems are possible to solve; and (3) complete a series of hands-on projects to implement, experiment with, and improve NLP models, gaining practical skills for natural language systems engineering"

277,3237,Civic Analytics & Urban Intelligence
277,1,
277,13551,"This course introduces students to computational approaches to urban challenges through the lens of city operations, public policy, and urban planning. Students are exposed to a range of analytical techniques and methods from the perspective of urban decision-making. Issues of city governance, structure, and history are presented to understand how to identify and assess urban problems, collect and organize appropriate data, utilize suitable analytical approaches, and ultimately produce results that recognize the constraints faced by city agencies and policymakers. This is not an easy task, and requires an understanding of urban social and political dynamics and a significant appreciation of data governance, privacy, and ethics. Specific attention is given to domain areas of energy and building efficiency, transportation, public health and emergency response, waste, water, and social connectivity and resilience, as well as the deployment of urban technology at the neighborhood scale. The role of civic engagement and community participation in the context of open data and citizen science is explored, as well as the evolving relationship between, and influence of, informatics on urban governance. Top-down and bottom-up models of innovative service delivery are discussed and debated in the context of public decision-making. Case studies and best practice examples from U.S. and global cities are used extensively, with a particular focus on New York City."

Businesses, governments, and individuals create massive collections of data as a byproduct of their activity. Increasingly, decision-makers and systems rely on intelligent technology to analyze data systematically to improve decision-making. In many cases, automating analytical and decision-making processes is necessary because of the volume of data and the speed with which new data are generated. We will examine how data analysis technologies can be used to improve decision-making. We will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining, and we will examine real-world examples and cases to place data-mining techniques in context, to develop data-analytic thinking, and to illustrate that proper application is as much an art as it is a science. In addition, we will work “hands-on” with data mining software."

281,3697,"Course description: All analytics projects rely on data. A crucial step in a business analytics process is creating the dataset that will be analyzed. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the stakeholders do not pay serious attention at this step; however, streamlining and understanding the data often takes 90% of the effort and time of a data analytics project. Furthermore, because most people do not know how the dataset was created, they miss important details and assumptions that were part of the data gathering and handling process, leading to serious problems down the road. This class is designed to teach students to handle data programmatically, without being software engineers. This course guides students through the whole data management process, from initial data acquisition to final data analysis. From a tools perspective, we cover Python and SQL. SQL is the lingua franca for all data analysts, and virtually all companies store their data in SQL-accessible repositories. Python serves as a great general-purpose programming language for a wide variety of data management tasks, and is commonly used as the “glue” that brings together all the different aspects of the analytics process."

R is a fast growing technology that has been witnessing widespread acceptance both in academia and industry. Recent surveys have even put it in the top regarding usage by professional data miners (Rexer Analytics survey, 2013). There are many factors contributing for this acceptance, but clearly these include the price (free), being open source (trustworthy software that can be easily inspected/checked for flaws), the extension of available methods (exponential growth of the set of available methods for different application areas), and the available support from the community (an extremely large community of knowledgeable experts proving top-notch support for free). This course illustrates the use of R for several key data mining processes. This illustration will be driven by concrete case studies that we will “solve” using R.

281,3701,"Course description: In every aspect of our daily lives, from the way we work, shop, communicate, or socialize, we are both consuming and creating vast amounts of information. More often than not, these daily activities create a trail of digitized data that is being stored, mined, and analyzed by firms hoping to create valuable business intelligence. With technological advances and developments in customer databases, firms have access to vast amounts of high-quality data which allows them to understand customer behavior and customize business tactics to increasingly fine segments or even segments of one. However, much of the promise of such data-driven policies has failed to materialize because managers find it difficult to translate customer data into actionable policies. The general objective of this course is to fill this gap by providing students with tools and techniques that can be utilized for making business decisions. Note that this is not a statistics or mathematics course. The emphasis of the class will be on applications and interpretation of the results for making real life business decisions."

281,3698,"Course description: Analytics is “the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions.” For example, sales data can help us understand consumer purchase behaviors as well as demand patterns. These insights can be used to make sales forecasts, which in turn can inform assortment and production planning decisions. Optimization models have played a very important role in turning “insights” into “decisions” for companies in various industries: advertising, airlines, energy, investment and finance, marketing, manufacturing, retailing, etc. This course is aimed at enriching the student exposure to business analytics techniques. It has two main parts. The first part covers sensitivity analysis, which is a follow-up of the linear programming topic covered in the Decision Models course, and which relates to understanding the impact of changing the parameters of a model on the optimal solution. It is executed using Excel Solver. The second part, which spans most of the course, covers decision making under uncertainty. Students will learn how to build optimization models that incorporate random parameters (e.g., stochastic demand, price, etc.)."

One of the best-known applications of PRM is yield management whereby airlines, hotels, and other companies seek to maximize operating contribution by dynamically managing capacity over time. Building on a combination of lectures and case studies the course develops a set of methodologies that students can use to identify and develop opportunities for revenue optimization in different business contexts, including the transportation and hospitality industries, retail, media and entertainment, financial services, health care and manufacturing, and others. The course places particular emphasis on discussing quantitative models needed to tackle a number of important business problems including capacity allocation, markdown management, dynamic pricing for e-commerce, customized pricing, and demand forecasts under market uncertainty, to name a few."

The result is a unified and practical case presentation on a topic of the group's choosing. This is a team-based project with approximately 4-6 students per group. The integrative projects should not take the form of formal dissertations or narrative papers. Rather, they should take the form of “reports to management,” emphasizing substance over length and the forest over the trees. Where possible, they should be action-oriented and framed in terms of business policy and competitive strategy. Given this format, they should be easily convertible into PowerPoint presentations."

Participants will build hands-on skills to analyze data in ways that complement the frameworks and intuitions they would normally use to guide their managerial actions on people issues. At a deeper level, students in any job, organization, or industry context will sharpen their ability to think critically through the lens of rigorous analytics. Anchored in data, this course will equip participants with an analytic approach to diagnosing the varied forces that influence individual, team, and organizational performance, leading to more effective interventions and actions. While developing analytic skills and trying out tools and techniques, participants will come to appreciate the opportunities, limits, and tensions involved in using data analytics to inform people issues, while simultaneously gaining deeper insight into the substance of the business issues in question"

1295,1,
1295,5275,"Data mining describes approaches to turning data into information. Rather than the more typical deductive strategy of building models using known principles, data mining uses inductive approaches to discover the appropriate models. These models describe a relationship between a system's response and a set of factors or predictor variables. Data mining in this context provides a formal basis for machine learning and knowledge discovery. This course investigates the construction of empirical models from data mining for systems with both discrete and continuous valued responses. It covers both estimation and classification, and explores both practical and theoretical aspects of data mining."

1339,13628,"This course provides an overview of the theory of financial markets from an economic perspective. The major conceptual tool that is used to study these phenomena is the notion of economic equilibrium. The course will build an understanding of the role of financial markets in hedging and insuring participants against risks. It will also cover the efficiency properties of financial markets and stress the perverse equilibrium effects that less-than-perfect financial markets can have: how vulnerable they may be to self-fulfilling prophecies and (ir)rational exuberance; the possibility of financial crises, in particular of bank runs, as self-fulfilling prophecies; and whether or not financial markets transmit and spread information that some traders have privately acquired on companies, currencies and other events."

1339,1,
1339,13345,"The MQE has partnered with the Paris 1 University Pantheon-Sorbonne to give selected MQE students the option to spend one semester in Paris, France, taking advanced courses in quantitative economics. In particular, MQE students will have access to the MSc in Models and Methods of Quantitative Economics 'Erasmus Mundus' (QEM). This program is run in partnership with other European universities, including Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Spain), IMW - Institute of Mathematical Economics of Universität Bielefeld (Germany) and Università Ca' Foscari Venezia (Italy), and attracts each year about 50 students from all over the world."
