COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

L.MBA 509 Big Data Ecosystem*

This course examines the data management process from access to data sources through implementation of scalable processes. Big data requires understanding database design, and increasingly involves parallel processing and cloud-based data storage and analysis. Data formats and database architectures are examined. Tools for extracting data from relational, structured, and non-structured databases are explored. Included are issues related to data security and governance. Students will also learn how to evaluate technologies used to implement scalable decision analytic systems. 3 credits

L.MBA 550 Data Visualization*

Data/Information visualization is widely used in a number of industries, including business, engineering, and media disciplines to help people analyze and understand what the data is telling us. The industry has grown exponentially over the last few years, and as a result there are more tools available to help us quickly and efficiently create compelling visualizations. 3 credits

This course provides an overview of the data/information visualization discipline. Using a hands-on approach, readings and lectures will cover various visualization principles and tools. Our labs will focus on practical introductions to tools and frameworks, with plenty of time to explore & utilize additional applications. We will discuss existing visualizations (e.g. what we find in various publications and government data sources) and critique their effectiveness in conveying information. All students are expected to participate in class discussion, complete lab assignments, and create & critique many data visualization examples throughout the session. 3 credits

L.MBA 520 Data Science*

Analytics is the process of taking data and turning it into new forms of value. The beginning of this process is often referred to as Data Science and the second stage of the process encompasses algorithms and visualization. As an introduction to data science, we proceed to cover practical data analytic skills including accessing and transferring data (ETL – extract, transform, load), applying analytical frameworks or patterns, applying methods from data mining and machine learning, and learning analysis methods for processing text. The course will also provide students an opportunity to do hands-on exercises with Big Data. The emphasis will be on practical usefulness and analytics patterns. 3 credits

L.MBA 530 Analytics Methods*

Business Analytics is the process of transforming data into business value. This process is often broken into stages of Data Science and Analytics Methods. The purpose of Analytics Methods is to use the data and rules resulting from data science methods and develop, test, and innovate business intelligence models to help solve common business problems. These methods originate in the fields of operations research, simulation, statistics, and machine learning. In this course, we model common business problems from the business domains of logistics, finance, marketing, and operations management using spreadsheets. 3 credits

L.MBA 515 Ethical and Social Responsibilities of Business*

This course consists of two parts. In the first, relatively brief part, we examine the ethical principles and theories that are relevant to resolving any moral issue. In the second part, we apply these principles and theories to the key moral issues in business (with emphasis, where appropriate and relevant, on questions dealing with data/information acquisition, analysis, and application) by studying, discussing, and debating them, principally through a case-study approach. The focus of our attention is on the three basic kinds of moral relationships in business: a) between the firm and the employee; b) between the firm and other economic agents (i.e., customers, competitors); and c) between the firm and various non-business groups (i.e., the environment). 3 credits

L.MBA 560 Marketing Analytics

Marketing remains a branch of business as well as a social science, and is often characterized by product, place, promotion, and price, and has been extended in many contexts to include people, packaging, and positioning. Each of these is a candidate for improvement through the use of analytics. In Marketing Analytics, we consider the analytics of:

Pricing, Forecasting Sales

Understanding Customer Demand

Customer Value

Market Segmentation

Retailing

Advertising

Market Research Tools

Internet and Social Marketing.

Topics include but are not limited to Price Bundling, Willingness to Pay, Profile Conjoint Analysis, Discrete Choice Analysis, Value Templates, Clustering and Collaborative Filtering, Bass Diffusion Models, Market Basket Analysis, Pay-per-Click Advertising, Principal Components Analysis, Measuring Nodes and Links, Network Contagion, and Viral Marketing Models. 3 credits

L.MBA 512 Business Strategy for Analytics

This course examines how analytics can be applied in various parts of the value chain. Students, working in teams, select an industry or canonical company and identify how analytics can be applied in various parts of its value chain. From this, they map out drivers of analytics value in the industry, and identify examples of analytics across functional areas or – ideally – segments of the value chain, for different users and with different time frames, e.g. smaller-data, more synthetic, strategic decisions for executives, down to real-time predictive analytics embedded in operational systems. Students will also examine how different functional managers (e.g., CFO, CTO, etc.) would view analytics decisions. 3 credits

*The former Business Analytics Overview Online Certificate will count in place of the L.MBA 512 course.

L.MBA 525 Managerial Economic Analysis

In this course, students will build on the basic undergraduate microeconomic framework by application and evaluation of theoretical models of decision making specifically related to business operations. Managerial economic analysis will proceed by covering practical microeconomic skills including supply and demand theory, consumer theory, cost analysis, market structures, regulation, and forecasting economic models. Exploration of these models will include derivation and application geared toward scenarios applicable from a managerial perspective. The course will also provide students an opportunity to do hands-on exercises with data to aid in application and interpretation of data in a microeconomic framework to comprehend and interpret consumer behavior and influence appropriate decision making within business settings. 3 credits

L.MBA 540 Machine Intelligence

Machine intelligence involves the set of technologies that permit computers to learn, including pattern recognition (text, image, and data), classification modeling, recommendation systems, natural language processing, and a variety of applications that increasingly are part of everyday life. Often referred to as “artificial intelligence,” this course goes further to explore techniques (such as recurrent neural networks and deep learning) which automate the ability of computers to recognize and identify patterns and learn from these. These techniques are scalable in ways that provide automatic implementation – ranging from web search algorithms to intelligent agents to self-driving cars. This course will provide hands-on experience building such systems, but with the focus on understanding the implications for business. Students will gain an appreciation for the scope of potential applications, the limits of machine intelligence, ethical aspects of their use, and disruptive tendencies of these technologies. 3 credits

L.MBA 555 Financial Management

The objective of this course is to help students understand financial decision making and modeling and how these are impacted by real world uncertainty. To achieve this, students will review basic financial concepts and then work on applying them through case studies and a course project. This is all done in the context of the need for socially responsible decisions to be made with all stakeholders in mind. Students will also learn about a variety of financial regulations and why they have been put in place.

Through the use of case studies and using Microsoft Excel, students will apply financial concepts to evaluate and analyze decisions that businesses make. To understand how financial decisions are made, students will create their own financial projections for a company and experience how financial decision making is impacted by the assumptions that go into the financial model. Financial concepts will include: current financial statement analysis and how to forecast future financial statements; capital budgeting; the cost of capital; financing operations; and risk management. 3 credits

L.MBA 571 Risk Analysis

An important part of business planning is identification, analysis, and management of risk. This spreadsheet-based course examines a variety of models geared to addressing business and social needs. Uncertainty is explicitly analyzed through the use of scenarios, simulation, and other techniques. Emphasis is placed on understanding and communicating the important uncertainties associated with any plan, and developing ways to incorporate these into business plans. 3 credits

L.MBA 581 Capstone Project

The goal of this course is to have students complete a data project (generally in groups) of a complex nature. This includes obtaining and cleaning relevant data, conducting appropriate analysis and communications of findings, and planning implementation of organizational processes that utilize the results of the project. Projects may come from students’ work environment, Center for Business Analytics sponsored projects, or other timely data projects that may arise at appropriate times. 3 credits

Was COMPSCI 590D. Undergraduate Prerequisites: COMPSCI 240 and COMPSCI 311. 3 credits

COMPSCI 585: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the engineering art and science of how to teach computers to understand human language. NLP is a type of artificial intelligence technology, and it's now ubiquitous -- NLP lets us talk to our phones, use the web to answer questions, map out discussions in books and social media, and even translate between human languages. Since language is rich, subtle, ambiguous, and very difficult for computers to understand, these systems can sometimes seem like magic -- but these are engineering problems we can tackle with data, math, machine learning, and insights from linguistics. This course will introduce NLP methods and applications including probabilistic language models, machine translation, and parsing algorithms for syntax and the deeper meaning of text. During the course, students will (1) learn and derive mathematical models and algorithms for NLP; (2) become familiar with basic facts about human language that motivate them, and help practitioners know what problems are possible to solve; and (3) complete a series of hands-on projects to implement, experiment with, and improve NLP models, gaining practical skills for natural language systems engineering

COMPSCI 589: Machine Learning

This course will introduce core machine learning models and algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. On the theory side, the course will focus on understanding models and the relationships between them. On the applied side, the course will focus on effectively using machine learning methods to solve real-world problems with an emphasis on model selection, regularization, design of experiments, and presentation and interpretation of results. The course will also explore the use of machine learning methods across different computing contexts including desktop, cluster, and cloud computing. The course will include programming assignments, a midterm exam, and a final project. Python is the required programming language for the course.

COMPSCI 590N: Introduction to Numerical Computing with Python

This course is an introduction to computer programming for numerical computing. The course is based on the computer programming language Python and is suitable for students with no programming or numerical computing background who are interested in taking courses in machine learning, natural language processing, or data science. The course will cover fundamental programming, numerical computing, and numerical linear algebra topics, along with the Python libraries that implement the corresponding data structures and algorithms. The course will include hands-on programming assignments and quizzes. No prior programming experience is required. Familiarity with undergraduate-level probability, statistics and linear algebra is assumed.

COMPSCI 590S: Systems for Data Science

In this course, students will learn the fundamentals behind large-scale systems in the context of data science. We will cover the issues involved in scaling up (to many processors) and out (to many nodes) parallelism in order to perform fast analyses on large datasets. These include locality and data representation, concurrency, distributed databases and systems, performance analysis and understanding. We will explore the details of existing and emerging data science platforms, including map-reduce and graph analytics systems like Hadoop and Apache Spark.

COMPSCI 689: Machine Learning

Machine learning is the computational study of artificial systems that can adapt to novel situations, discover patterns from data, and improve performance with practice. This course will cover the popular frameworks for learning, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning. The course will provide a state-of-the-art overview of the field, emphasizing the core statistical foundations. Detailed course topics: overview of different learning frameworks such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning; mathematical foundations of statistical estimation; maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation; missing data and expectation maximization (EM); graphical models including mixture models, hidden-Markov models; logistic regression and generalized linear models; maximum entropy and undirected graphical models; nonparametric models including nearest neighbor methods and kernel-based methods; dimensionality reduction methods (PCA and LDA); computational learning theory and VC-dimension; reinforcement learning; state-of-the-art applications including bioinformatics, information retrieval, robotics, sensor networks and vision.

STATISTC 535: Statistical Computing

This course will provide an introduction to the use of SAS for statistical analyses. Coverage includes data entry and manipulation, descriptive statistics and basic statistical analyses, including at least inferences for means and proportions in one and multi-sample settings and contingency tables.

Fall Courses

Principles of Urban Informatics

This course is the introduction to the core disciplines of data acquisition and management, integration, and analytics. Students will learn the major concepts, tools, and techniques for what informatics can do for cities. It includes background in computation, statistics, error analysis, data acquisition, management, integration, working with large datasets and understanding data sources. The course covers topics in visualization, data analysis and modeling, and machine learning, focusing on their application on urban problems, and including material not usually covered in computer science courses: how to handle spatial-temporal data, GIS, issues related to citizen science and participatory sensing, instrumentation, physical sensors, imagery, and issues of data ethics, privacy. This class is Python based.

Civic Analytics & Urban Intelligence

This course introduces students to computational approaches to urban challenges through the lens of city operations, public policy, and urban planning. Students are exposed to a range of analytical techniques and methods from the perspective of urban decision-making. Issues of city governance, structure, and history are presented to understand how to identify and assess urban problems, collect and organize appropriate data, utilize suitable analytical approaches, and ultimately produce results that recognize the constraints faced by city agencies and policymakers. This is not an easy task, and requires an understanding of urban social and political dynamics and a significant appreciation of data governance, privacy, and ethics. Specific attention is given to domain areas of energy and building efficiency, transportation, public health and emergency response, waste, water, and social connectivity and resilience, as well as the deployment of urban technology at the neighborhood scale. The role of civic engagement and community participation in the context of open data and citizen science is explored, as well as the evolving relationship between, and influence of, informatics on urban governance. Top-down and bottom-up models of innovative service delivery are discussed and debated in the context of public decision-making. Case studies and best practice examples from U.S. and global cities are used extensively, with a particular focus on New York City.

Applied Data Science

This course introduces students to the theory, principles and applications of mathematical and computer modeling of data as applied to cities. It will be based on two unified themes: foundations for predictive analytics and decision-making followed by applications in data science. The 1st half of the course will cover predictive modeling using a wide array of examples, including predictive modeling, an advanced treatment of regression, visualization and graphics, and automated analysis for high dimensional data. The second half will introduce students to applications in data science such as analytics of images and video as well as subjective data processing and analysis.

Urban Spatial Analytics, OR

CUSP-GX 7002

In this course, students will learn how spatial analysis can support the exploration of geographical properties, patterns, and phenomena in urban context. The course will cover the foundations of spatial analysis in the spatial sciences, examining in particular how spatial science influences data collection, data modeling, data analysis, and data interpretation. The course will explore the derivation of core spatial statistics and geostatistics that are routinely used in geographical analysis. The course will also examine the use of spatial analysis in supporting spatial modeling. The course is rooted in an exploration of the theory underpinning spatial analysis and the derivation of analysis schemes, rather than hands-on software training. Students are expected to have undertaken prior coursework in Geographic Information Systems and exploratory spatial data analysis, as well as introductory multivariate statistics. Example sets in the course will focus on urban analysis.

Urban Decision Models

This course provides an introduction to computer-based optimization and simulation models for decision-making for government officials and policy makers. The emphasis is on models that are widely used in diverse functional areas, including every day operations such as waste collection, policing and transportation to policy making on environment/climate change to sheltering the homeless. Applications will include resource allocation, workforce planning, revenue management, asset-liability management (public sector finance models), environmental policy modeling, pension and bonding planning, and political campaign management, among others. The aim of the course is to help students become intelligent consumers of these methods. To this end, the course will cover the basic elements of modeling- how to formulate a model and how to use and interpret the information a model produces. The course will attempt to instill a critical viewpoint towards decision models, recognizing that they are powerful but limited tools.

Data Governance, Ethics & Privacy Lab

CUSP-GX-1007

This supplementary lab teaches students to recognize where and understand why ethical issues can arise when applying analytics to urban problems. One of the learning objectives is to consider what ethical obligations scientists may have to those who figure in their research, as well as those to whom the lessons are later applied.

Spring Courses

Urban Science Intensive I

CUSP-GX-5005

The Urban Science Intensive I course introduces students to their projects and the Agency and Industry mentors involved and develops team-building; students meet with various officials at the relevant agencies and industry partners, tour relevant projects and facilities, and begin to engage the community; student teams define the problem and craft a strategy to identify solutions, inventory available and needed datasets, and explore possibilities for new instrumentation and citizen engagement to support project objectives. This course involves a combination of lectures, student team project work, in-class group work, site visits, and guest speakers.

Summer Courses

Urban Science Intensive II

CUSP-GX-9002

Student teams engage in projects through the integration and analysis of data, definition and testing of possible solutions, identification of implementation strategies and constraints, and recommendation of a preferred solution and implementation plan. Student teams are challenged to utilize urban informatics within the real-world constraints of city operations and development, while cognizant of political, policy, and financial considerations and issues of data privacy, validity, and transparency. In so doing, student teams will be tasked with creating innovative and replicable solutions to pressing urban problems. The end product of the Intensive sequence is intended to be the result of the integration of multiple skill sets from each student’s area of specialization in domain, discipline, and entrepreneurial/ organizational leadership focus.

ELECTIVES

As a student in CUSP’s graduate programs, you will further customize your education with specialized CUSP electives in data science, domain applications, and civic analytics. Students may also take up to two non-CUSP data science or domain application electives from other schools across NYU, including but not limited to the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Stern School of Business, Wagner School of Public Service, and Tisch School of the Arts.

NYU CUSP’s electives include:

Machine Learning for Cities

CUSP-GX-5003

The objective of this course is to familiarize students with modern machine learning techniques and demonstrate how they can be effectively applied to urban data. The course is practice-oriented: concepts and techniques are motivated and illustrated by applications to urban problems and datasets. For that reason, it involves a significant programming component, with Python as the primary programming language. Topics include a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning methods, such as support vector machines, clustering algorithms, ensemble learning, Bayesian networks, Gaussian processes, and anomaly detection. Strategies for effective machine learning and discussion of the limitations of ML as well as a variety of supplementary techniques are also considered.

Data Visualization

CUSP-GX-6006

Visualization and visual analytics systems help people explore and explain data by allowing the creation of both static and interactive visual representations. A basic premise of visualization is that visual information can be processed at a much higher rate than raw numbers and text. Well-designed visualizations substitute perception for cognition, freeing up limited cognitive/memory resources for higher-level problems. This course aims to provide a broad understanding of the principals and designs behind data visualization. General topics include state-of-the-art techniques in both information visualization and scientific visualization, and the design of interactive/web-based visualization systems. Hands on experience will be provided through popular frameworks such as matplotlib, VTK and D3.js.

Advanced Topics

CUSP-GX-6004: Justice Systems Algorithms

The growing use of data-centric technologies is transforming criminal justice in the United States. These technologies affect the scale and nature of collected data, enable the detection of discriminatory patterns of policing, and influence bail recommendations for pretrial detainees, among other things. Modern computational and statistical methods offer the promise of increased efficiency, equity, and transparency, but their use raises complex legal, social, and ethical questions. In this course, we will discuss the application of techniques from machine learning and statistics to a variety of criminal justice issues, analyze recent court decisions, and examine the relationships between law, public policy, and data. The course will involve readings and class discussion, short assignments, and a data-intensive semester-long project. The course will also feature guest speakers who work in the criminal justice domain. Students should have basic knowledge of statistics, programming, and supervised machine learning, but no prior knowledge of the criminal justice system will be assumed.

CUSP-GX-6004: Managing IT

All new public sector and private systems are information technology (IT) systems. This course will improve your IT IQ. It will explain how to create and operate IT systems and task IT staff so that they meet stakeholder expectations for improving productivity, cost effectiveness, availability and address other government and business challenges. The information in the course will also help students more productively interact with IT professionals to be more satisfied IT customers. IT system development and use have gotten a reputation for problems and high costs. We’ve read about data breaches at popular companies such as Yahoo, Target, Apple, and IBM. We’ve also read about or maybe even experienced well-known failures like the launch of the US’ Healthcare.gov and NYC’s CityTime payroll management system. Well known fiascoes like these cause people to think that it’s impossible to deliver and operate quality IT systems. How then can government and business improve their operations? Organizations can achieve high performance creating and running IT systems by using well researched and documented practices to deliver IT projects and conduct IT operations with high levels of quality. Many best practices can be found in both the private and public sectors. This course will emphasize best practices for public sector organizations.

Data Driven Mobility Modeling

CUSP-GX-9007

The goal of this course is to provide the students with the tools and methods to understand basics of traffic flow theory, modeling and simulation. The emphasis will be on the use of real-world data to supplement the understanding of the theory behind the models. Small scale simulation models will be developed, tested and validated against real-world data.

Urban Sensing

CUSP-GX-7009

Remote sensing technologies are becoming increasingly available at better resolution levels and lower costs. This course will provide an overview of some of the most common technologies in the areas of imagery, video, sound, and hyperspectral data that can be facilitated through smart phones or other readily accessible means. Students will be given a formal introduction to the aforementioned four areas and then be afforded an opportunity for hands on training in data collection and data analysis. In the course will have the opportunity to work in small groups to investigate an urban problem of interest to them at a site of their choosing. The teams will use these new learned technologies in tandem with other publicly accessible data (either formally available or also collected by the researchers) to investigate a working hypothesis about their chosen urban problem for their site.

Applied Data Analytics for Public Policy

CUSP-GX-2505

The goal of the Applied Data Analytics class is to develop the key computer science and data science skill sets necessary to harness the wealth of newly-available data. Its design offers hands-on training in the context of real microdata. The main learning objectives are to apply new techniques to analyze social problems using and combining large quantities of heterogeneous data from a variety of different sources. It is designed for students who are seeking a stronger foundation in data analytics.

Monitoring Cities

CUSP-GX-6005

The world’s urban population is growing by nearly 60 million per year; equivalent to four cities like New York annually. Monitoring the chronological growth of key attributes of cities, as well as quantifying their current conditions presents a great potential for positive change. Through the acquisition of new data, there are immediate opportunities to influence the sustainable growth of small and medium size cities. There is also the potential for alleviating the extremes in Megacities, where conditions have reached a critical and unmanageable state. Looking at cities as interdependent networks of physical, natural and human systems, this course provides a perspective on how to monitor the function and wellness of these systems. Students obtain an understanding of needs assessment, planning, and technical approaches for instrumenting a city. This includes monitoring patterns of activity, mobility, energy, land use, physical and lifeline infrastructure, urban ecology, vegetation, atmosphere and air quality. The expected outcomes of this course is a comprehensive understanding of what can be instrumented and the monitoring architecture for acquiring and generating new data about cities.

Urban Big Data Management and Analysis

CUSP-GX-5008

This course will provide an understanding of Big Data and current technologies for managing and processing Big Data. At the course end, students will have the ability to decipher when and which software tools to utilize for a particular project/urban challenge: e.g. NoSQL for web UI, Spark for back-end, SQL for transaction controls, etc. The course is designed to provide a high-level understanding of big data platforms.

CAPSTONE PROJECTS

During the Capstone Program, you will work in a multidisciplinary environment with a city agency or industry partner to address a current urban challenge in a particular domain, such as transit, public health, or environmental sustainability. You will play an important role in the project, working with other researchers — and even entrepreneurs — to unlock the potential in big data to make your city better.

Capstone projects may be part of larger, ongoing NYU-CUSP research efforts involving city agencies and NYU‑CUSP industry partners, self-contained projects involving agencies and industry partners, or more entrepreneurial in focus and content, where you and a team of students will work on developing a new solution derived from your analysis.

Pre-Module

Pre-module 1 is the period from March to May before students arrive to the in-class residential period of the module. During this time, the MSBA program will distribute pre-readings, assignments, group work, and online sessions so that students can get up to speed for their module 1 coursework. This period is also an opportunity for the cohort to meet each other virtually before the program convenes on campus in May.

Module I

Foundations of Statistics Using R

Previously co-taught by: Kristen Sosulski, Peter Lakner

Course description: The purpose of this course is to ensure that students are prepared to use R as a statistical tool and understand the fundamental statistical concepts. This course is divided into two parts: 1) Getting Started with R and 2) Statistics and R.

Part 1: Getting started with R: The R portion of the course will equip students with the skills needed to work with data using the R statistical computing application. This begins with developing a basic understanding of the R working environment. Second, students will learn to use R while being introduced to the necessary arithmetic and logical operators, and salient functions for manipulating data. Next, students will be introduced to the common data structures, variables, and data types used in R. Students will learn how to develop their own R scripts and utilize the various packages available in R for visualization, manipulation, and statistical analysis. Students will learn how to import data sets and transform and manipulate those datasets for various analytical purposes such as dealing with missing data. Finally, students will learn how to create control structures, such as loops and conditional statements to traverse, sort, merge, and evaluate data.

Part 2: Statistics and R: In the second part of the class basic concepts of probability and statistics will be introduced. We shall study the concepts of population and sample, discuss the difference between population parameters and sample statistics, and draw inferences from known sample statistics to usually unknown population parameters. We shall study discrete distributions along with their means and standard deviations, paying particular attention to the binomial distribution. We shall also study continuous distributions and their probability density functions, paying special attention to the most central of the continuous distributions—the normal distribution. The Central Limit Theorem will be introduced, and confidence intervals and statistical tests will be discussed. We shall then study the simple and multiple linear regression and their applications to prediction and forecast.

Topics covered:

Getting started with R (commands, arithmetic operators, logical operators, functions)

Data structures and types

Writing scripts

Descriptive statistics

Statistical graphs

Working and manipulating data sets in R



Digital Marketing Analytics

Previously taught by: Anindya Ghose

Course description: The emergence of the Internet has drastically changed marketing. Some traditional marketing strategies are now completely outdated, others have been deeply transformed, and new digital marketing strategies are continuously emerging based on the unprecedented access to vast amounts of information about products, firms, and consumer behavior. The Internet is now encroaching core business activities such as new product design, advertising, marketing and sales, creation of word-of-mouth, new start-up funding, and customer service. Our goal in this class is to discuss the new business models in electronic commerce that have been enabled by Internet-based social media and advertising technologies, and to analyze the impact these technologies and business models have on industries, firms, and people. We will inform our discussions with insights from data and metrics that can guide us for measurement. To recognize how businesses can successfully leverage these technologies, we will therefore go beyond the technology itself and investigate some key questions.

Topics covered:

Econometric regression modeling

Selection problems

Omitted variables problems

Endogeneity

Log transformations

Econometrics-based tools



Introduction to Business Analytics

Previously taught by: Foster Provost; Alex Tuzhilin

Course description: This course will change the way you think about data and its role in business. Businesses, governments, and individuals create massive collections of data as a byproduct of their activity. Increasingly, decision-makers and systems rely on intelligent technology to analyze data systematically to improve decision-making. In many cases, automating analytical and decision-making processes is necessary because of the volume of data and the speed with which new data are generated. We will examine how data analysis technologies can be used to improve decision-making. We will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining, and we will examine real-world examples and cases to place data-mining techniques in context, to develop data-analytic thinking, and to illustrate that proper application is as much an art as it is a science. In addition, we will work “hands-on” with data mining software.

Topics covered:

Data mining and data mining processes

Introduction to predictive modeling

Data fitting and over fitting

Model testing

Cross-validation and learning curves

Model performance analytics

Unsupervised learning and clustering

Bayesian reasoning and text classification



Dealing with Data

Previously taught by: Panos Ipeirotis

Course description: All analytics projects rely on data. A crucial step in a business analytics process is creating the dataset that will be analyzed. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the stakeholders do not pay serious attention at this step; however, streamlining and understanding the data often takes 90% of the effort and time of a data analytics project. Furthermore, because most people do not know how the dataset was created, they miss important details and assumptions that were part of the data gathering and handling process, leading to serious problems down the road. This class is designed to teach students to handle data programmatically, without being software engineers. This course guides students through the whole data management process, from initial data acquisition to final data analysis. From a tools perspective, we cover Python and SQL. SQL is the lingua franca for all data analysts, and virtually all companies store their data in SQL-accessible repositories. Python serves as a great general-purpose programming language for a wide variety of data management tasks, and is commonly used as the “glue” that brings together all the different aspects of the analytics process.

Topics covered:

Data modeling and ER model

Relational databases and SQL

Accessing data sources: Web APIs

Data manipulation using Python Pandas

Regular expressions and Web Crawling

Text Analytics



Decision Models

Previously taught by: Jiawei Zhang; Ilan Lobel

Course description: This course trains students to turn real-world problems into mathematical and spreadsheet models and to use such models to make better managerial decisions. This is a hands-on course that focuses on modeling business problems, turning them into Excel spreadsheet models and using tools like Solver and Crystal Ball to obtain solutions to these managerial problems. The course focuses on two classes of models: optimization and simulation. The application areas are diverse and they originate from problems in finance, marketing and operations. We cover problems such as how to optimize a supply chain, how to price products when faced with demand uncertainty, and how to price exotic financial options using Monte Carlo simulation.

Topics covered:

Linear and linear integer programming

Nonlinear programming and evolutionary solver

Simulation and optimization

Multi-period linear programming

Monte Carlo simulation



Big Data

Previously taught by: Norm White; Ramesh Shankar

Course description: This course offers an in-depth hands-on exploration of various cutting-edge information technologies used for big data analytics. The course will cover background readings on the theoretical foundations of Hadoop and MapReduce, as well as business articles on how Hadoop and related technologies are used by companies. Students have the opportunity to be hands-on with Hadoop – specifically, Linux, Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS), Apache Sqoop, Apache Pig and Apache Hive – for data management and extract-transform-load (ETL) operations. Students will have an understanding of the MapReduce algorithm and how it is used to run SQL-like queries in parallel on the Hadoop architecture.

Module II

Data Mining in R

Previously taught by: Luis Torgo

Course description: The goal of this course is to provide hands-on experience on key data mining technologies using one particular tool—the R environment. R is a fast growing technology that has been witnessing widespread acceptance both in academia and industry. Recent surveys have even put it in the top regarding usage by professional data miners (Rexer Analytics survey, 2013). There are many factors contributing for this acceptance, but clearly these include the price (free), being open source (trustworthy software that can be easily inspected/checked for flaws), the extension of available methods (exponential growth of the set of available methods for different application areas), and the available support from the community (an extremely large community of knowledgeable experts proving top-notch support for free). This course illustrates the use of R for several key data mining processes. This illustration will be driven by concrete case studies that we will “solve” using R. The course can be regarded as a hands-on complement of the Data Science for Business Analytics.

Topics covered:

Data pre-processing (dealing with unknown values)

Defining the data mining task

Classification approaches

Performance estimation for time series models

Modeling and performance estimation

Model outcomes and model selection

Data Driven Decision Making

Previously taught by: Vishal Singh; Rob Seamans

Course description: In every aspect of our daily lives, from the way we work, shop, communicate, or socialize, we are both consuming and creating vast amounts of information. More often than not, these daily activities create a trail of digitized data that is being stored, mined, and analyzed by firms hoping to create valuable business intelligence. With technological advances and developments in customer databases, firms have access to vast amounts of high-quality data which allows them to understand customer behavior and customize business tactics to increasingly fine segments or even segments of one. However, much of the promise of such data-driven policies has failed to materialize because managers find it difficult to translate customer data into actionable policies. The general objective of this course is to fill this gap by providing students with tools and techniques that can be utilized for making business decisions. Note that this is not a statistics or mathematics course. The emphasis of the class will be on applications and interpretation of the results for making real life business decisions.

Topics covered:

Regression-based model development

Capturing non-linear effects: dummy variables & log transformations

Estimating & Interpreting log demand models

Using log-regressions to understand competitive marketplace



Operations Analytics

Previously taught by: Harry Chernoff

Decision Under Risk

Previously taught by: Gustavo Vulcano; Ilan Lobel

Course description: Analytics is “the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions.” For example, sales data can help us understand consumer purchase behaviors as well as demand patterns. These insights can be used to make sales forecasts, which in turn can inform assortment and production planning decisions. Optimization models have played a very important role in turning “insights” into “decisions” for companies in various industries: advertising, airlines, energy, investment and finance, marketing, manufacturing, retailing, etc. This course is aimed at enriching the student exposure to business analytics techniques. It has two main parts. The first part covers sensitivity analysis, which is a follow-up of the linear programming topic covered in the Decision Models course, and which relates to understanding the impact of changing the parameters of a model on the optimal solution. It is executed using Excel Solver. The second part, which spans most of the course, covers decision making under uncertainty. Students will learn how to build optimization models that incorporate random parameters (e.g., stochastic demand, price, etc.).

Topics covered:

Sensitivity analysis for linear programming

Decision analysis

Two-stage stochastic optimization with recourse

Dynamic programming

Module IV

Revenue Management and Pricing

Previously taught by: Rene Caldentey; Gustavo Vulcano

Course description: Revenue management and Pricing (RMP) focuses on how firms should manage their pricing and product availability policies across different selling channels in order to maximize performance and profitability. One of the best-known applications of PRM is yield management whereby airlines, hotels, and other companies seek to maximize operating contribution by dynamically managing capacity over time. Building on a combination of lectures and case studies the course develops a set of methodologies that students can use to identify and develop opportunities for revenue optimization in different business contexts, including the transportation and hospitality industries, retail, media and entertainment, financial services, health care and manufacturing, and others. The course places particular emphasis on discussing quantitative models needed to tackle a number of important business problems including capacity allocation, markdown management, dynamic pricing for e-commerce, customized pricing, and demand forecasts under market uncertainty, to name a few.

Topics covered:

Demand segmentation

Price differentiation

Constrained pricing

Marginal value of capacity

Network revenue management

Pricing policies in action

Demand forecasting and data analysis



Data Privacy and Ethics

Previously taught by: Solon Barocas

Course description: There is a growing sense of urgency around the ethics of analytics. Harvard Business Review, for instance, declared that “oversight for algorithms” and “data privacy” would be among the top trends that business professionals could not ignore in 2016. Our class will tackle these topics head-on. Together, we will explore what it means to use analytics ethically and how to think about its ethical implications. We will approach these matters from the perspective of professionals who lead analytics-oriented teams or organizations, and whose success depends on their ability to recognize the ethical issues at stake and resolve these to the satisfaction of multiple stakeholders.

Topics covered:

Understanding sources of unfairness in analytics

Unique challenge that analytics pose for privacy

Policy responses and proposals

Conducting experiments ethically



Strategy, Change and Analytics

Previously taught by: JP Eggers

Course description: This course focuses on significant strategic decisions—such as the introduction of new products or the acquisition of another firm—and explores how data-driven and analytical approaches can be used to inform these decisions from a senior management perspective. A case-based approach allows us to discuss details of significant strategic decisions. We will cover some core aspects of business strategy, including external analysis, competitor analysis, and opportunity analysis. We will also look more deeply at different aspects of the decision-making process within organizations, both to understand the process and to think about implementation. The goal is to understand the role of analytics and analytical approaches in the broader organization.

Topics covered:

Value creation and capture

Firm positioning versus competitors

Ratio analysis in strategy

Flexibility and commitment in strategy

Leading organizational change; causality and interpretation of analytical results

Module V

Strategic Capstone

The Capstone project, which students work on throughout the year, is presented at the culmination of the program. This integrative exercise gives students an opportunity to review and interpret data through statistical and operational analysis with the use of predictive models and the application of optimization techniques. The result is a unified and practical case presentation on a topic of the group's choosing. This is a team-based project with approximately 4-6 students per group. The integrative projects should not take the form of formal dissertations or narrative papers. Rather, they should take the form of “reports to management,” emphasizing substance over length and the forest over the trees. Where possible, they should be action-oriented and framed in terms of business policy and competitive strategy. Given this format, they should be easily convertible into PowerPoint presentations.

Mobile Analytics

From wearable tech and the internet-of-things to smartphone devices and digital wallets, billions of people around the world are harnessing mobile devices to access information, connect with others, and conduct business. Mobile analytics offers fertile ground to unlock valuable information and insights for businesses and organizations. Previous capstone projects have focused on the following: designing predictive models to identify successful mobile applications, creating mobile applications to optimize business operations, and developing strategic recommendations for mobile marketing budget allocation.

Workforce Analytics

Workforce analytics is growing in the field of human resources and has been strongly represented by MSBA capstone projects. Previous projects have utilized advanced analytics methods to improve business practices in various ways, including predicting talent acquisition, identifying drivers for workforce performance, estimating company retention rates, and anticipating fraudulent behavior within a company.

Health Care Analytics

Past projects focusing on the health care/pharmacy sector range from improving operational efficiency in hospitals by using analytics, establishing data-driven revenue generation models for health care facilities, and creating predictive models to suggest new facility locations for optimal pharmacy sales.

Human Rights Analytics

Business analytics can also be used for the social good. Previous capstone projects have utilized analytics in an attempt to provide tools to the public and private sector in the fight for human rights related issues. Past project topics include the prevention of child abduction, HIV/AIDS treatment, and the protection of vulnerable populations in Central Africa.

Energy Analytics

Climate change and disruptions in our environment have a direct impact on businesses and the overall economy. MSBA students have completed projects concentrated around this central point. Past projects include: the development of mobile applications that anticipate air quality indices impact on daily profits, predictions for electrical vehicle demand, and smart grid resource allocation.

Sports Analytics

The movie Moneyball—depicting the story of Paul DePodesta and his use of analytics in baseball—put sports analytics in the headlines. Capstone projects for the MSBA program have taken sports analytics further by developing analytical models to inform coaching methods, recruitment strategies, and training for the NBA and the burgeoning field of mixed martial arts (MMA).

company. This class introduces some fundamental statistical models which are very effective in explaining and predicting marketing patterns using new forms of information emerging from the technology advances. These models can significantly improve the decisions by practitioners as they also offer intuitively sounds descriptions on various observed data patterns. Meanwhile, as more and more firms adopt

sophisticated toolkit to conduct business analysis (Excel toolkit, SPSS and etc.), understanding these statistical models can become an essential part of regular business. The contents we covered in this course will be helpful for managers to get the greatest business value in today’s data intensive business environment. We will also apply these statistical models to real marketing problems using real marketing data. Students are expected to finish a final project by applying techniques covered in this class on a real world dataset. This is because the core of developing the quantitative skills in this class is through hands-on exercises. This project is designed to enhance students’ understanding of the concepts introduced in this class, and to allow students to have the opportunity to absorb the skills rather than just get exposed to them.

In addition, this course devotes significant attention to interpreting and using models to make decisions, along with reviewing common complexities of data analysis such as endogeneity. By the end of the course, students will be able to complete a rigorous analysis from start to finish, consisting of initial problem identification, data analysis and model specification, and finally making an informed decision based on the results. All data analysis and visualizations will be done in R.

Applied Probability Models (2 credits) This course applies fundamental concepts of probability to data analysis and forecasting. The methodological focus is on both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches to statistical inference. Particular attention is placed on count, choice and timing models, with heterogeneous latent variables. Applications will be drawn from a wide range of business settings, such as new product forecasting, modeling customer retention and lifetime value, and market segmentation.

Business Analytics Capstone Internship (4 credits) The Business Analytics Capstone Internship integrates the students’ specific knowledge of business analytics learned during the MSBA program with the key skills of critical thinking, independent research, interdisciplinary learning, and civic engagement. Students are required to either 1) engage in a part time (no more than 20 hours per week) internship with a company in a role in the analytics field during the Spring semester or 2) engage in a semester-long project with local companies in the analytics field. This is a required semester-long course for all full-time students to understand the complexities of a complete analytics project and the major components of the system development life cycle (SDLC). A solid understanding of the business is the foundation upon which successful analytics projects are built. This project will allow students to apply the academic concepts, including the analysis of the business needs which have been discussed in the classroom. Students will receive 4 credit hours for this course. Students will be required to complete a set of deliverables as part of the project to be graded, regardless of whether they take on an internship or engage in the semester-long project.

Business Analytics Consulting (2 credits) Understanding and documenting the business processes and decisions that business analytics are expected to support is central to developing solutions that improve organizational performance. In this class, students will learn the conceptual frameworks, tools and skills needed to develop a blueprint for analytics. This entails successfully analyzing the high-level requirements for business analytics, prioritizing and outlining solutions, proposing business process improvements to generate the requisite data, and making the business case.

Machine Learning in Predictive Analytics (2 credits) This course examines a variety of data mining methods such as machine learning/decision trees, neural networks, clustering, unstructured data analysis (a.k.a. text mining) and association rules.

Learning will take place through lecture and considerable hands-on engagement with these tools. Topics include Data Warehouse, ETL, Advanced SQL, and etc.

Consumer Behavior (2 credits) This course is the study of why people buy what they buy. It includes an in-depth examination of the consumer decision-making processes and the factors that influence those processes. We closely look at how people make product-related decisions and the information used to make those decisions. The course is taught from a consumer-psychology perspective and shows how that perspective can be applied to business.

Customer Insights and Market Intelligence (2 credits) This course demonstrates how firms can use primary and secondary data to gain insights about the product market and its customers and competitors. Such insights form the basis of making sound marketing decisions related to product, price, place and promotions. Emphasis is laced on quantitative and qualitative analytical approaches to inferring insights. Topics include marketing metrics; market dynamics analysis; and gaining insights from attitudinal, behavioral, and online data.

Data-Driven Marketing (2 credits) In this course, students will be taught a variety of models that are commonly used in marketing analysis. Students will learn how to target customers using logistic regression, segment customers with cluster analysis, and develop perceptual maps using factor analysis. In addition to learning traditional marketing analysis techniques, this course reviews collaborative filtering, linear discriminant analysis, topic modeling, and principal components analysis, among others. The emphasis on this course is on using sophisticated methods to make better marketing decisions. All data analysis and visualizations will be done in R.

Forecasting and Predictive Analytics (2 credits) This course provides an introduction to a variety of common statistical techniques for predictive analytics and forecasting. The key topics that we will cover include qualitative techniques, smoothing and decomposition of time series, regressions, the Box-Jenkins Methodology. We will emphasize on hands-on applications using a statistical package JMP, rather than technical foundations and derivations. We will also critically study these techniques, examining both their usefulness and limitations. Through this course you will learn to model uncertain business outcome, so that you can more effectively manage such uncertainty.

Managerial Decision Making (2 credits) The purpose of this course is to help you become a better decision maker. More than anything else, what managers, analysts, and consultants do is make decisions. We will discover a series of mistakes that typical businesspeople, including you, make in a variety of managerial decision contexts, including hiring decisions, investment decisions, purchase decisions, and strategic decisions. We will do so using insights from behavioral sciences (such as psychology, behavioral economics, consumer and organizational behavior). At the same time, we will explore how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions. Instead of relying on mathematic models or academic theories, the class is organized in a “workshop” format with a combination of case studies, discussions, student presentations, and exercises illustrating and applying the main concepts. This class will teach you the most important “soft skills” that will help you to become, and stay, a successful businessperson.

Managing Big Data - Managerial (2 credits) This course focuses on core concepts in the adoption of Big Data technologies by modern enterprises. We'll balance lecture and discussion with some in-class lab work which will give you a foundational understanding of these technologies.

Operations Analytics (2 credits) Organizations invest the bulk of their human and financial resources in their operations functions. In this course, students will study analytical models and techniques that can be used to improve operational and firm performance. Decision making under uncertainty will be addressed using static stochastic optimization, two-stage optimization with recourse, dynamic programming and game theory. Optimization models will be used to tackle problems in inventory management, revenue management, supply chain management, forecasting and new product development. Students will also learn how strategic decisions can be aided by data-driven, analytical models. The goal is to understand the role that analytics and analytical models can play in improving an organization’s operational processes.

Project Management (2 credits) Managing projects in a cost effective and timely manner is one of the most challenging tasks in any organization. Competent project leadership requires understanding of how to allocate financial, material and time-based resources, and the ability to motivate and maintain focus of the project team. This course provides relevant project management skills by examining project decisions at three levels; (i) structuring and managing the task and leading the project team in an individual project, (ii) aggregate linkages across a portfolio of projects and management of programs, (iii) project contracting, partnering and open innovation. It introduces tools and concepts that enable project managers to evaluate, manage and execute critical functions of any project while ensuring speed, efficiency and market impact.

Research for Marketing Decisions (2 credits) Marketing research is the formal process of gathering information needed by managers to make decisions – decisions about marketing opportunities and problems, decisions to determine and evaluate the marketing mix, and decisions based on monitoring market performance. Decisions such as: Should a new product be introduced? What are the effects of a competitor’s action? What are the most effective channels of distribution? How do marketing actions affect brand awareness or sales revenue? In this course, you will gain a solid foundation in designing and executing effective marketing research through lectures, interactive discussions and a hands-on marketing research project with a sponsoring corporation. Through the project, you will design the research, collect customer data, and analyze the data using statistical methods relevant to your research problem. In a final group presentation to company leaders, you will draw customer insights from your analysis and propose strategic and tactical recommendations for profitable growth.

Retailing Analytics (2 credits) The vast majority of consumer expenditures, which represent more than $5 trillion dollars and 68 percent of the United States gross domestic product, are made through retailers. Moreover, the average consumer product company spends as much on trade promotions (such as promoting its products to retailers) as it does on media advertising and consumer promotions combined. These facts highlight the importance of retailer behavior and trade promotions in consumer marketing. This course takes the retailer’s point of view, exploring strategic and tactical decision-making by assessing the impact of these decisions on both consumer shopping behavior and the retailer’s own operating costs. Students explore issues in sales promotion, pricing, product mix, and store location in order to gain an understanding of consumer response in these areas.

Revenue Management (2 credits) The revenue management approach is to exploit differences in customer segments and their willingness to pay. This course introduces some of the models and methods used in the developing field of revenue management (RM). As we develop various RM models, I will expose some new modeling techniques (e.g., dynamic programming, heuristic approximation) and some that you may have seen before (linear programming, nonlinear optimization).

Understanding What Customers Value (2 credits) Determining what is valued is perhaps the most important issue facing marketing managers. Recently, conjoint and choice models have become popular techniques to help marketing managers understand what customers value in terms of the importance placed on specific product features and services. The objective of this course is to expose students to a variety of preference models used by brand managers and marketing analysts and to give students hands-on experience in using conjoint and choice modeling techniques. This course examines these marketing decisions using a combination of lectures, cases and exercises.

Details



Total tuition costs and fees may vary, depending on the instructional method of the courses in which the student chooses to enroll.



The more courses a student takes in a single term, the more they will typically save in fees and total cost.



Face-to-face or partially online courses are charged at the general tuition rate and all mandatory campus fees, based on the student's residency (non-residents are charged at a higher rate).



Fully or entirely online course tuition rates and fees my vary depending on the program. Students enrolled in exclusively online courses do not pay non-Resident rates.



Together this means that GA residents pay about the same if they take all face-to-face or partially online courses as they do if they take only fully online courses exclusively; while non-residents save money by taking fully online courses.



One word of caution: If a student takes a combination of face-to-face and online courses in a single term, he/she will pay both all mandatory campus fees and the higher eTuition rate.

The online Master of Science in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics degree at Saint Mary’s University is an experiential program that delivers data governance and visualization skills that hiring managers notice immediately. While this degree focuses efforts on learning how to pull, assess and present data — it also teaches you how to be successful as you work around the daily challenges that are simply a part of working with big data. You’ll use a combination of real-time big data sets from Fortune 500 companies and the tools needed to navigate this complex environment throughout the year-long program — emerging as a polished professional who can drive optimum results regardless of circumstance.



Real-Time Data Sets
You’ll complete assignments using real-time data from Fortune 500 companies. And by real-time, we mean that data sets are sometimes pulled from companies and delivered the same day as your course. Furthermore, no one cleans them up for you. Data sets remain ""ugly"" — either containing too much data, or too little. They can also be corrupted. You’ll learn to work through these challenges as you’re expected to in the corporate world.



Programming Languages
Learning a program language is the number one skill needed to effectively manage big data. It allows you to reach through the sea of variable information, quickly accessing the specific data sets you need to inform decision-making. You have a choice in learning either R or Python, but have the option of taking both courses.



Professional Feedback
No less than three times throughout the program, student work is critiqued by a panel of experts, again from Fortune 500 companies — providing insight and exposure to your rapidly growing skill set. They’ll carefully review your work and consider your recommendations, asking the same questions of you as they would executives who presented to them. This deepens your understanding of stakeholder needs, sharpens your presentation and research skills, and provides incredible real-world experience.

Data is extremely relevant in today’s world. It’s being generated at all times, arriving from multiple sources at an alarming rate. Everything is generating data, from a farmer’s combine on the fields to a patient’s electronic medical records to the videos you watch on YouTube.

Data experts say that 90 percent of the data that exists in the world today was created in the last two years. This growth in data shows no signs of slowing down.

What’s more, we increasingly rely on data to tell us new things about the world. As “big data” has emerged, a new job market has developed with it: businesses in all sectors have realized that they need scientists with the technical knowledge and statistical abilities to analyze, manipulate and act on the available data, and then communicate their findings to the world.

That’s where you come in.

Data Science & Analytics builds on a core of computer science, information technology and systems, mathematics and statistics. Data Science is, in simple terms,

the extraction of knowledge from data. Analytics is a sister term, used mostly in business settings to characterize the analysis of business data to describe, predict,

and improve business performance. These disciplines include statistical analysis, machine learning, data mining, probabilistic modeling, computer programming,

distributed and high performance computing, and database management. Graduates of the data science & analytics program develop a thorough understanding of the

field, learn to manage data effectively, are prepared to apply statistical techniques for the analysis of data, and learn to explore data, communicate data analysis findings

through visualizations and build models from data to describe phenomena and make predictions on future occurrences and events

COMPSCI 590M: Introduction to Simulation

How can we use computers to design systems and, more generally, make decisions, in the face of complexity and uncertainty? Simulation techniques apply the power of the computer to study complex stochastic systems when analytical or numerical techniques do not suffice. It is the most frequently used methodology for the design and evaluation of computer, telecommunication, manufacturing, healthcare, financial, and transportation systems, to name just a few application areas. Simulation is an interdisciplinary subject, incorporating ideas and techniques from computer science, probability, statistics, optimization, and number theory. Simulation models, which embody deep domain expertise, can effectively complement machine-learning approaches. This course will provide the student with a hands-on introduction into this fascinating and useful subject.

Job Possibilities: Data Science Concentration Graduates

Positions graduates will be ready for range from highly technical business data analysts to entry level data scientists. A person working in a data science environment today needs to know how (a) to ask relevant and sharply focused questions of business data, (b) to access data and use software languages to answer those questions, (c) to present results and visualizations, (d) to communicate effectively with non-technical management, (e) to understand business paradigms in the field, and (f) to critically evaluate the work of data scientists. Our academic advisory board for the concentration is made up of top data scientists at LinkedIn, Yahoo!, Macys, and Acxiom. They suggest that this chain of skills is critically needed. They believe that data scientists not only include computer scientists well versed in Big Data, but also those who understand markets, the tools of data science, the paradigms of business, and are able to pose fundamental business questions.

For example, it is not important to know the technical aspects of cloud computing, but one should know what it is and where it fits into the business strategies of firms. It is not important to be able to write sophisticated software or regression analysis tools, but it is necessary to know how to design and undertake regressions using the appropriate software to thoughtfully address the question at hand. Extensive knowledge of database engineering is not needed, but being able to extract data from databases to run analyses is needed. Modern day data analytics goes well beyond running Excel, so the skill set must include stronger analytic tools.

When a student is able to pose good questions, identify basic problems, and has the skills to use data well, within the appropriate economic paradigms, the student’s skill set will be applicable to a wide set of disciplines in business. The spillover benefits are wide-ranging, as students will find that courses in this concentration prepare them to be much more adept, both conceptually and technically, in other courses in the usual disciplines of marketing, finance, economics etc.

Big data is used to describe a vast quantity of data that is so large that it becomes too difficult to manage using traditional technologies. Big data is commonly defined using the three Vs:



Volume: The vast amount of data available, which leads to storage and management issues.



Velocity: How fast data is being produced and aggregated and how fast the data must be processed to meet demand.



Variety: The number of types and sources of data, which can be structured and unstructured and can come from virtually anywhere.



Data analytics make it possible to extract a fourth V: Value.


",Definition,
1201 [M] Master of Science in Data Analytics.docx,"
How big is big data? +

According to IBM, people create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day.
",Fluff,
1201 [M] Master of Science in Data Analytics.docx,"
What is data analytics? +

Data analytics is the process of transforming vast amounts of raw data into constructive, actionable information.

To derive insights from large amounts of data, a data analyst must store, manage, sort, structure, and mine the data using highly sophisticated tools. The analyst can then apply refined data analysis to discover trends and influence business decisions.

Where does big data come from? +

Just as the volume of big data keeps growing, so do the sources. From commercial transactions to social media posts, personal data to weather patterns, nearly all data today is being tracked and recorded. It is up to data analysts to uncover the real potential.

Why is big data important? +

Great strides have been made in the gathering, storage, and security of big data, but the real opportunity is in the data analysis.

Its application is virtually limitless, and will shape the world we live in, from the way we interact on a personal level to how businesses and governments evolve. The increased use of big data in virtually every sector has created a talent gap for data analysts.

Why is data analytics important? +

The ever-increasing generation of data has rendered it unmanageable by traditional means, and the diversity of data sources makes finding insights even more complex.

Highlights of Bioinformatics Concentration

Computational Biology and Molecular Biology: Understanding the science behind the biological data is necessary for fostering the insight required for making meaningful observations. So students will become well versed in the biological sciences, with an emphasis on microbiology and cellular biology, central dogma as well as algorithmic approaches for effective computation DNA/RNA sequencing and mapping, sequence alignment, and gene prediction.

Databases: Researchers must archive very large amounts of data and share it amongst multiple people or groups. So Bioinformaticians must routinely retrieve and update datasets from databases. Students will understand how to interface with such databases and learn to acquire, store, and organize their data using common SQL operations.

Machine Learning: Use methodologies that automate the knowledge discovery process. Machine learning provides techniques for creating software that dynamically determines the criteria for making decisions about the data without human intervention. This includes techniques such as evolutionary algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks.

Data Mining: Bioinformaticians must extract important features from extremely large datasets or identify similarities across multiple datasets. Students will apply knowledge of statistics to build software capable of clustering and classifying unknown or hidden patterns within data.

Data Visualization: Learn to create informative visual representations of complex data. In many scientific applications the data is too complex for traditional charts, graphs, and plots. As such, data visualization experts must use special techniques to develop new ways of representing this complex data. The importance of data visualization is to intuitively model complex or abstract data so that we can make observations that were difficult to make before.

STAT 564 Applied Regression Analysis (3 credits) and
STAT 565, 566 Experimental Design: Theory and Methods, (3 credits each)

Additional applied statistics courses: The objective is developing a breadth of knowledge in the application of statistical methods within the discipline and in related areas. A minimum of 12 additional hours chosen from the list of theory and interdisciplinary courses below. Please note that 510/610 courses and STAT 551, 552 are not acceptable toward the certificate.

",Requirements,
1074 [C] Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics.docx,"
This Graduate Certificate credential may be completed with a minimum of 24 credit hours of statistical graduate coursework with no comprehensive exam, while the MS in Statistics requires more extensive coursework and examinations.

Graduate certificate students must have a minimum 3.00 GPA on all courses applied to the program of study, as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in all graduate-level courses taken at PSU. Although grades of C+, C, and C- are below the graduate standard, they may be counted as credit toward a graduate certificate with the specific written approval of the program.

Students are responsible for knowing University-level graduate policies and procedures for obtaining the certificate. These policies and procedures are in Graduate Studies section of the PSU Bulletin. Several of the most frequently asked about University-level graduate policies and procedures can also be found on the Graduate School web site.
",Requirements,
1074 [C] Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics.docx,"
Many graduate programs include a research methods component that requires the student to acquire some exposure to statistical methods as the basis for the design of experiments and analysis of data. The Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics (GCAS) goes well beyond those requirements -- the student develops both a depth of understanding of methods and a breadth of application across disciplines. It is expected that a student who earns this certificate would be capable of performing sophisticated statistical analysis and modeling for problems within his or her particular discipline. They would also be expected to be able to access and understand consultation with professional statisticians and provide consultation in the application of statistical methods for research purposes and in the solution of practical problems. The goal of the GCAS program is a coordinated plan for which students will be assured of exposure to statistical techniques needed in most applications.
",Mission,
1074 [C] Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics.docx,"
Please see the University's Tuition and Fees web page. Use the cost of attendance estimator tool for a rough estimate of your attendance costs per term. The certificate is a minimum of 24 credits. You could finish the certificate in 3 quarters (not counting summer term) with full-time enrollment of three classes per term (9 credits).

Certificate programs are ineligible for a graduate teaching assistantship.

1074 [C] Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics.docx,"
Prospective students must have a basic preparation in mathematics and statistics and in a particular disciplinary field that would allow for advanced work in statistical methods as well as applications in one or more content areas. This preparation must be demonstrated by the completion of calculus-based courses in probability and distribution theory. A background in basic statistical methodology is assumed. Prerequisites for the GCAS are: 3 terms of calculus (MTH 251-253), linear algebra (MTH 261), and a statistical methods course (STAT 452/552). As the sequence STAT 551,552 is a prerequisite, it is not applicable toward program requirements.

In addition to program prerequisites, applicants must meet the university's minimum admission requirements including English language proficiency.

Please note that this program is not appropriate for students currently enrolled in the MS Statistics program.

Case studies and exercises will be drawn from real-world examples (e.g., bioinformatics, public health, marketing, and security).

SYS 6018: Data Mining | Credits: 3

Data mining describes approaches to turning data into information. Rather than the more typical deductive strategy of building models using known principles, data mining uses inductive approaches to discover the appropriate models. These models describe a relationship between a system's response and a set of factors or predictor variables. Data mining in this context provides a formal basis for machine learning and knowledge discovery. This course investigates the construction of empirical models from data mining for systems with both discrete and continuous valued responses. It covers both estimation and classification, and explores both practical and theoretical aspects of data mining.

DS 6014: Bayesian Machine Learning | 3

Bayesian inferential methods provide a foundation for machine learning under conditions of uncertainty. Bayesian machine learning techniques can help us to more effectively address the limits to our understanding of world problems.

Complex Systems: Time Series
This course provides a rigorous introduction to modeling and prediction of financial time series. The goals are to learn basic characteristics of financial data, understand the application of financial econometric models, and gain experience in analyzing financial time series.



Data Science for Quantitative Finance
This course introduces students to building data science models for financial applications. These models will be created using reproducible data science workflows, using modern statistical programming tools and techniques. The course will first focus on obtaining data from various sources, preparing and transforming data as needed for downstream analysis, and performing exploratory data analysis. We’ll then look at the most important descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytic techniques for analytical financial modeling.



Financial Economics
This course provides an overview of the theory of financial markets from an economic perspective. The major conceptual tool that is used to study these phenomena is the notion of economic equilibrium. The course will build an understanding of the role of financial markets in hedging and insuring participants against risks. It will also cover the efficiency properties of financial markets and stress the perverse equilibrium effects that less-than-perfect financial markets can have: how vulnerable they may be to self-fulfilling prophecies and (ir)rational exuberance; the possibility of financial crises, in particular of bank runs, as self-fulfilling prophecies; and whether or not financial markets transmit and spread information that some traders have privately acquired on companies, currencies and other events.
